  Description:
    Abstract:
      This map layer portrays the 1990 State and county boundaries of the United 
      States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The map layer was 
      created by extracting county polygon features from the individual 
      1:2,000,000-scale State boundary Digital Line Graph (DLG) files produced 
      by the U.S. Geological Survey.  These files were then merged into a single 
      file and the boundaries were modified to what they were in 1990.  This 
      is a revised version of the November 2004 map layer.      
    Purpose: 
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.  
      No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States 
      in the use of these data.

        The COUNTYBD file was modified to reflect the 1990 county boundaries for 
        the United States.  The following changes were made: In Alaska, the 
        Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area and Yakutat Borough were combined to 
        create the Skagway-Yakutat-Angoon Census Area.  Also, Denali Borough was
        combined with the Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area.  In Virginia, the polygon 
        for South Boston was added.

        and making adjustments in Alaska, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, and 
        Virginia.  In addition, State names were changed from abbreviations to 
        the full State name.

        attribution was removed from the Niagara River between Lake Ontario and

        Numerous additional minor boundary adjustments were made throughout 
        the country.  In Puerto Rico, Florida Municipio was added and an 
        offshore island was added to Ponce Municipio.  A extra polygon within 
        Vega Baja Municipio was merged with the rest of the municipio. 

        An attribute containing the area in square miles for the county was
        added.  It was calculated by summing values in the area field for each
        county, which is in square meters, and multiplying the results by 
        0.0000003681.
